Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
   ANS: Software engineering is like a structured approach to building everything from phone apps to websites to massive systems. It involves designing, creating, testing, and maintaining software applications or systems.
In the tech industry, software engineering fuels innovation, drives efficiency, and ensures that systems are robust, scalable and secure. Without it, we wouldn't have the tech giants we rely on daily, like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. It's like the backbone of the digital age, enabling everything from social media to critical healthcare systems. Software engineering ensures that technology works smoothly and reliably. Itâ€™s what keeps our modern world ticking.


2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  The Advent of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s-1960s): The creation of high-level languages like FORTRAN and COBOL marked a significant milestone. These languages abstracted complex machine code into more human-readable syntax, making programming more accessible and efficient.

Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): This approach encouraged a disciplined method of writing software using clear, structured code. It emphasized the use of control structures like loops and conditionals, leading to more reliable and maintainable programs. Edsger Dijkstra's famous letter, "Go To Statement Considered Harmful," was pivotal in promoting this methodology.

The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001): The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, revolutionized software engineering by promoting iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility over rigid planning and documentation. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban became widespread, significantly improving how software projects were managed and delivered.

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.




Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
